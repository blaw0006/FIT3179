    <h1>The Fourth Wave</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <p>In late February, 2021, having already suffered immense casualties from the first three waves, Malaysia began its 
      <strong>national immunisation programme</strong> in an attempt to reduce the 
      severity of the forecasted waves of COVID-19. This visualisation examines the efficiency and speed with which different
      Malaysian states administered vaccines to its population over the <strong>first month</strong> of the programme.

  <div class="text-block">
    <p>Some states were more responsive than others to the news of the national immunisation programme, with <strong>Putrajaya</strong> 
      reaching over 10% of first dose vaccinations by the end of the first month. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the states with the 
      largest populations were not the most organised - <strong>Selangor</strong> and <strong>Sabah</strong> both had very low 
      vaccination rates by the start of April. Most of the states had a <strong>low efficiency</strong>, since a majority of the population 
      registered for a first dose, but had not received one by the end of the first month.

    <p>Here is a more graphical view of the first dose vaccination status of the different Malaysian states by the end of March 
      2021.

    <p>Taking a closer look at first and second dose vaccinations, it appears that most of the population that had received 
      a first dose <strong>also received</strong> a second dose by the end of the first month of the programme. Still, both numbers remained 
      <strong>relatively low</strong> for most states.
